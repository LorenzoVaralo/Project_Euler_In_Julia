# Project Euler In Julia

Project Euler is a website containing hundreds of mathematical problems for you to solve using any programming language, for this repository I decided to use the Julia language so I can practice, I can also note that Julia just seams like the perfect language for those exercises due to its velocity and simplicity.

To solve the exercises I used the Pluto IDE, which is a cell based web IDE, similar to Jupyter, that is why the exercises can have strange comments and notations.

You can run any exercise by inserting `julia Ex<number>.jl` into a terminal, and it will print the right answer, but it can be more beneficial to look up the code and understand my thought process.

Check.jl is a julia program that I made to quickly check the answers, displaying if it is right or wrong, the answers inserted in the function Check will be hashed and compared to the hashed list of answers at Answers.txt. To have this list of answers I used the files of the repo at [euler-offline](https://github.com/davidcorbin/euler-offline), which contains the questions and hashed answers. The hashed answers are impossible to decode, so it can only be used to compare, I did not have access to the direct answers at any step of the process.
