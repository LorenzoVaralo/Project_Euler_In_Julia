# Project Euler In Julia

Project Euler is a website containing hundreds of mathematical problems for you to solve using any programming language, for this repository I decided to use the Julia language so I can practice, I can also note that Julia just seams like the perfect language for those exercises due to its velocity and simplicity.

To solve the exercises I used the Pluto IDE, which is a cell based web IDE, similar to Jupyter, that is why the exercises can have strange comments and notations.
